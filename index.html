        <span class="night">// Freedom from the prying eyes of corporations.</span><br />
        [ "<span class="slime">In our time of data capitalism, we have become the products of power hungry corporations like Facebook and Google- their primary means of collecting data about us being our smartphones. 
          By nature, android phones that you buy off the shelf come jam packed with google service trackers that send hundrends of packets of data back to their servers every minute even when turned off in order to 
          construct detailed profiles on you. The ZeroPhone uses GraphineOS, a de-googled and privacy intensified rebuild of android developed by a group of passionate programmers. This, along with our other modifications 
          make you just about unidentifiable by these corporations.</span>" ]<br /><br />
  
        <span class="night">// High perfoance device.</span><br />
        [ "<span class="slime">We use only the best performing devices. The base model of the ZeroPhone uses hardware from the Google Pixel 3 and the pro model, the Google pixel 4. These devices perform very consistently 
          both with excellent screens, battery and performance. Furthermore, with our modifications of minimising constant surveillance, the performance and battery both work to a higher standard. </span>" ]<br /><br />
        
        <span class="night">// Pre-installed open-source and privacy conscious apps.</span><br />
        [ "<span class="slime"> Out of the box, we have installed some apps which act as either privacy conscious alternatives you may need which we strongly recommend to use, or apps that will help protect your privacy. note: you can delete them if u find you do not use them.Here are some of the apps and our alternatives.<br /><br />

In some cases however, google services are required for 
          some apps to function properly and you can contact us if you have any queries about a certain app you need. *warning* Although most apps are supported on this device, many of these apps have trackers built into the apps
          which puts your privacy at risk so we recommend you visit this site will tell you the the amount and what trackers are in the app. Using this infromation consider carfully before choosing the apps you use. 
          The absoulte safest option is to use only the apps pre-installed and apps from F-droid.</span>" ]<br /><br />

        [ "<span class="slime">The measures taken in the modificaiton of the ZeroPhone were in order to ensure privacy from corporation surveillance NOT THE GOVERNMENT. This means, although you are protected from Facebook and Google, your internet service provider and hence the government will be able to access all your internet activiy, calls and text messages.</span>" ]<br /><br />
